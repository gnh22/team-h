## Animal Crossing: New Horizons
*Animal Crossing: New Horizons (ACNH)* is a 2020 social simulation game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch. It is the fifth main installment in the Animal Crossing series. In New Horizons, the player controls a character who moves to a deserted island after purchasing a getaway package from Tom Nook, accomplishes assigned tasks, and develops the island as they choose. They can gather and craft items, customize the island, and develop it into a community of anthropomorphic animals. (Wikipedia)

## About Critter O'Clock
Since ACHN is variable-dependent (meaning certain bugs and fish only appear during partciular hours, months, weather conditions, hemispheres, etc.) we created an app that allows the user to know which bugs and fish can be caught given their real, current time and month. If the user wants to view all of the bugs and fish available in the ACNH universe, they can navigate to the glossary page. If the user wants to view all of the bugs and fish available given partciular variables, the user can navigate to the filter page and choose their desired variables and filter the critters. On each page the critters have a dropdown view that gives details about its hemisphere, time, location, sell price, and seasonal availability.
