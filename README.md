# ACNH: Critter O’Clock
### **Team-H: Michelle Hong & Grace Hines**

Animal Crossing: New Horizons (ACNH) is a game that is time dependent so our app aims to allow users to open the app and see what bugs, fish, etc. are available during their current time. The user would also be able to navigate to another page to input a desired time/date/hemisphere to look at what items are live with specific variables.
